==========

*TDD Rails app to upload and display collection of 2000+ graffiti magazines*

While this site is designed to show off the images in a rare collection of magazines, the biggest challenge was actually creating a smooth, streamlined back-end entry UI with JavaScript and AJAX, since the collection had never before been catalogued.

Over time, we will upload the entire collection, make it searchable/filterable based on where and when an issue was published, publisher, featured crews, and other physical dimensions (which helps curators choose issues for their exhibits).
